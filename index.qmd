# Bio
Hello! I am Sakura an I am a third year Computer Science Specialist at University of Toronto!
If you would like to contact me for any personal projects don't hestitate to contact me through the information at the bottom of the page!

A little more about myself: 
  * Some of my hobbies include swimming, reading (although I don't get a lot of time for it) and listening to music. I used to learn the piano but that was a long time ago ðŸ˜€. 
  * Future hobbies if I get the time: Skating, Snowboarding (can you tell I love winter), and learning to play the piano again!
  * I have 2 completely different interests in terms of academics. I love the applications of computer science in biology and also in cyber security. I think its interesting how we can use these tool to help people in ways that make it more efficient in terms of time and cost!
  
Academic Interests I am currently pursuing: Investigating the capabilities of generative AI. Especially the commercialized ones that is accessible to the public, such as ChatGPT and Copilot.
